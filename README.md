The python notebook is on googles new collabatory tool. Its a churn model being run on 3 different algorithms to compare. 
The telecom churn data can be found on-

The interface is different than normal python notebooks but it is understandable. Name: Churn_Model.ipynb

Note: the collabtory version can only be viewed if you have a nbviewer version hence i am also putting up a python notebook so that the code can be read completely. Name: Xgboost Vs Litegbm Vs Catboost.ipynb
